Automated Risk Insight System (ARIS)

üìå Project Overview
The Automated Risk Insight System (ARIS) is an AI-powered system designed to analyze IT incidents, predict risk levels, and estimate resolution times using machine learning models. It also includes an interactive chatbot that allows employees to query incident data and receive intelligent recommendations while maintaining security rules for data access.
This application is built with FastAPI, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and Ollama LLM for natural language processing. Google Gemini Pro and OpenAI ChatGPT 4o, o1 and o3, helped with debugging, making and optimizing the models.

üéØ Purpose & Key Features
ARIS provides automated assistance for IT risk management and operational decision-making. The system:
‚úÖ Predicts risk categories (HIGH_RISK / LOW_RISK) based on incident attributes. 
‚úÖ Estimates incident resolution times using a machine learning regression model. 
‚úÖ Allows employees to interact with incident data via a chatbot that enforces access control rules. 
‚úÖ Provides references to the original data source for employees to inspect the raw information. 
‚úÖ Works without requiring manual input of resolution time ‚Äì it first predicts resolution time before using it in risk classification.

üèó How It Works
1Ô∏è‚É£ Input: The application takes incident reports in JSON format, excluding time_to_resolution. 
2Ô∏è‚É£ Step 1 - Predict Resolution Time: 
Uses the train_model_new_res.py regression model to predict resolution time. 
3Ô∏è‚É£ Step 2 - Predict Risk Level: 
Uses the train_model_orig_risk.py classification model, now including the predicted time_to_resolution. 
4Ô∏è‚É£ Step 3 - LLM Chat Interaction: 
Employees can ask questions via the chatbot to get AI-powered insights.
Chatbot enforces security rules based on the employee‚Äôs credentials.
Employees can get a reference to the original data source.

üîç Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
Source: Kaggle IT Incident Log dataset
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shamiulislamshifat/it-incident-log-dataset
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning:
Dropped unnecessary columns (number, sys_created_by, sys_updated_by, etc.)
Converted categorical features to numerical using Label Encoding
Saved encoders for consistency in predictions
2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering:
Time to Resolution Calculation: Derived from opened_at and resolved_at timestamps
Incident Complexity Score: Based on reassignment_count, reopen_count, and priority
Escalation Flag: Assigned if reassignment_count > 2
SLA Breach Indicator: Marked incidents with time_to_resolution > 24 hours
3Ô∏è‚É£ Final Processed Dataset Saved: engineered_incident_data.csv

üîß Technical Stack
Backend: FastAPI
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SMOTE
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy, Pickle
LLM Chatbot: Ollama (Llama 3.1 8B model)
UI & API Requests: Streamlit, Requests
Database: JSON file-based storage (can be extended to SQL/NoSQL databases)
Knowledge base idea: Tested on the side in Open WebUI with Ollama server 

üöß Challenges & Blockages Encountered
1Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Mismatch in Models
The initial design of the models required time_to_resolution, but the JSON input lacked this field.
Solution: The system was redesigned to first predict time_to_resolution before using it in risk classification.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Scaling & Data Transformation Issues
Incorrect transformations led to extremely high or negative resolution times.
Solution: Switched to MinMaxScaler for improved numerical stability.
3Ô∏è‚É£ LLM API Connectivity Issues
The chatbot initially failed to respond due to missing or incorrect model references.
Solution: Ensured Ollama LLM was running, verified API endpoints, and fixed formatting issues in responses.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Limited Time for Development & Testing
Due to time constraints, further optimizations (e.g., fine-tuning models, database integration) were not implemented.

üöÄ Future Development & Usage
ARIS has significant potential for expansion and adaptation to different use cases:
üîπ Enhanced Security & Role-Based Access
Improve the chatbot to enforce access rules dynamically based on roles.
Implement OAuth authentication for employee login.
üîπ Integration with External Data Sources
Connect to SQL databases or enterprise ticketing systems (e.g., ServiceNow, Jira).
Allow direct queries into structured databases instead of JSON storage.
üîπ Multi-Language LLM Capabilities
Expand chatbot beyond English, supporting multilingual environments.
Train the LLM to handle specialized IT incident-related knowledge.
üîπ Automated Incident Escalation & Workflows
Trigger automatic escalations based on predicted HIGH_RISK incidents.
Integrate with email alerts, Slack, or Microsoft Teams notifications.

‚ö° Conclusion
Despite encountering various challenges, the Automated Risk Insight System (ARIS) successfully demonstrates the potential of AI-powered risk analysis and decision-making in IT incident management. The system functions correctly within its current scope, predicting resolution times and risk levels, and providing a chatbot for intelligent data interactions.
With further development, ARIS can become a fully operational AI-driven IT assistant, improving efficiency, reducing manual workload, and ensuring better risk handling in enterprise environments.
